<P><em>Want to know more about CarTalk.com?  DBC certainly does, especially about the source code</em></P>
<P>CarTalk.com is a very complicated site.  Looking at the source code, can be a bit confusing.  Most of it looks foreign.  Keyword, <b>MOST</b>.  Not all of it looks confusing because there is code embedded in the site that suddenly looks understandable.   I see familiar block elements like image and website links.  I see code for tables and headers and lists.  Suddenly what I am seeing is not as foreign as it appearead not so long ago.  Even better, some of the code I don't fully understand, I am still able to guess what it does.  This is based off the lessons this week.  It is interesting seeing familiar aspects in foreign code.
